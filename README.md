To build and train a model of human cell records using SVM and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant. SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized even when data are not otherwise linearly separable.A seperator between the categories is found,then data is transformed in such a way that the seperator could be drawn as a hyperplane.
